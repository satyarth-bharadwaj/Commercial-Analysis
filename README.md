ETL Process for SAP Data

Overview

This project is designed to streamline ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for SAP data, ensuring efficient and structured data handling for inventory and supply chain management. By leveraging Python, Pandas, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy, the system extracts raw data from SAP, applies necessary transformations, and loads the refined data into a MySQL database for further analysis and reporting.

Project Objectives

Automate Data Extraction: Retrieve SAP data from multiple sources and store it in structured formats (CSV/JSON).

Data Transformation & Cleaning: Standardize, normalize, and map SAP fields to align with the MySQL schema using Pandas.

Efficient Data Loading: Utilize SQLAlchemy to facilitate seamless bulk insertion into MySQL tables.

Inventory & Supply Chain Insights: Enable businesses to analyze product demand trends, supplier lead times, and inventory levels.

Data Warehousing & Reporting: Implement a star schema design for optimized querying and generate actionable insights through Power BI dashboards.

Key Features

End-to-End ETL Pipeline: Ensures seamless data extraction, transformation, and loading.

Inventory & Sales Analytics: Identifies slow-moving and fast-moving products based on recent sales data.

Reorder Level & Demand Forecasting: Predicts optimal stock levels and reorder points.

Supplier Performance Analysis: Evaluates supplier efficiency based on historical lead times.

Scalability & Performance Optimization: Uses efficient database structures and aggregation strategies to handle large datasets.

Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Database: MySQL (Data Storage & Querying)
